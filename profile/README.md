## ⚡ Snap. Lock. Fire. Welcome to Triggerbot Heaven.

Half-Life: Alyx in VR already feels next-level — but imagine your gun firing **automatically** the second your aim touches an enemy. No more missed shots, no pulling the trigger too late. That’s exactly what the **triggerbot mod** does, and it’s *insanely OP* when used right.

Whether you're pushing through Combine squads or wiping out antlions, this mod gives you mechanical-tier reflexes, without breaking immersion.

## 🔍 What’s a Triggerbot in VR?

A **triggerbot** is a smart mod that fires your weapon automatically when your crosshair or reticle lands on an enemy’s hitbox — no manual input needed. In VR, it adapts to your controller tracking, making it feel seamless and fast.

Pair it with ESP or aimbot, and you're basically a walking turret.
